In case a user does not have the right date, 

We can use a Time API, e.g from Windows to get the correct time and compare with clients time.

If the result is negative, we can setup alerts to let the user know their time is wrong.

Incase, we do not wish to update the user, we can get the time from the API and set it as the time variable.

This variable can then be saved in the DB.
